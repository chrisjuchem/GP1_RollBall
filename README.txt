Notable changes:
- Multiple play areas with color-coded teleporters to access them.
- Non-player game objects bob up and down as well as spin.
- Dynamically calculated score and goal.
- Tweaked size/rotaion values for objects in the level.
- Automatic restart if all pickups are collected, or 
  if the player manages to fall off the level.

** All functions in scripts were tested and debugged ** 
**    with multiple playtests of the entire game.    **
